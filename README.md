# Finnish-English Translations Repository

Welcome to the Finnish-English Translations repository! This project is dedicated to building and maintaining a comprehensive database of Finnish language words and their English translations. We invite contributors from the language learning and enthusiast community to help us expand and improve this valuable resource.

## Getting Started

### Using Translations

- To access the translations, explore the [`translations.json`](./src/data/translations.json) file. This JSON file
  contains over 2000+ and a growing list of Finnish words and their corresponding English translations.

- Here is the format of the translations

```json

[
  {
    "word": "tekniikka",
    "partOfSpeech": "noun",
    "definition": "technology",
    "example": "Tämä yritys panostaa uuteen tekniikkaan. (This company is investing in new technology.)",
