# Code of Conduct

We, as contributors and maintainers of the Finnish-English Translations project, pledge to create a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Code of Conduct outlines the standards of behavior we expect from all contributors. Please review it in detail: [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We encourage all contributors to report any behavior that violates the Code of Conduct to the project maintainers.

Thank you for helping us make this a safe and inclusive space for all.
